# NSO-Applet-API

An API library and documentation for the NSO Applet on the Nintendo Switch.

This library implements various endpoints from the NSO Webapplet, with the intention of completely covering all endpoints and documenting them.

[See the documentation here](/lp1.nso.nintendo.net.md)

You can download this library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nso-applet-api/) by running the following in your Python environment:
```sh
python -m pip install nso-applet-api
```

### This project is a work-in-progress and is currently unfinished!
